            Emerging Patterns in Building GenAI Products

    <div class="content-body">
        <p>The team at ThoughtWorks have distilled several patterns that they've found useful in building GenAI products.  Some of these patterns have emerged from the new range of problems that these tools present: &quot;including hallucination, unbounded data access and non-determinism.&quot;</p>
<h1>Direct prompting</h1>
<p>Llm will not know anything beyond what it was trained or things that happened since.  May not know the context it's operating in and therefore it may not prioritize it's knowledge.</p>
<p>Habits of misleading replies and over confidence.  Hallucinate.</p>
<p>In order to use this pattern you need to figure out how good the results of the prompting is.  Thought works has found that a strong emphasis on a systematic and deliberate testing of AI systems is crucial to allow for changing them in various ways in the future.</p>
<h1>Evals</h1>
<p>Gen AI cannot be evaluated deterministically therefore you must use a scoring engine of some sort.  You can evaluate a model based on individual output however more often you use a range of scenarios.</p>
<p>You can use a few different ways to evaluate a model's outputs: One is to have the model self evaluate. Next is to have another LLM model b the judge. Lastly a human evaluation is also quite useful when you have to see if the model quote unquote gets it.</p>
<p>Generally LOM has judge and combining with human evaluation works the best.  This leverages automated feedback and human feedback as well which is crucial to know if the tone and clarity of the messages correct.</p>
<p>Evals will have to be tested based on a threshold rather than simple pass or fail given that they are non-deterministic.</p>
<p>Indeed it is best to establish a benchmark collecting various data points and charting their variance over time.</p>
<p>Scoring and judging is still an inexact science given that we are still in the early days of this tech. It will continue to evolve and change.</p>
<p>Embeddings</p>
<p>Encoding's capture the meaning of data which allows for better comparisons and relationships.  However they are not ideal for structured or relational data.</p>
<p>Embeddings provide a way to index large quantities of unstructured data.</p>
<h1>Rag</h1>
<p>Rag is an effective tool for use with specialized knowledge bases.  However you have to present it with the correct documents.<br>
One of the best ways to do this is to leverage embeddings.  You need to let it know that it needs to determine when it doesn't have sufficient data. And to also use this data explicitly.</p>
<p>Rag allows you to add data beyond what a model is trained on and beyond the date that it was trained on.  It is great for rapidly changing data.</p>
<p>The contacts provided can help mitigate biases in the original training.</p>
<p>Generally, Rag is much more cost effective than fine tuning.</p>
<p>Chunk retrieval by itself isn't efficient.</p>
<h1>Fine tuning</h1>
<p>Fine tuning is usually not the best approach given that it's expensive to do.</p>
