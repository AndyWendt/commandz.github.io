        <p>Autonomy &amp; Empowerment</p>
<p>I read Elizabeth Ayer’s article on signaling intent that you shared and then I started snooping around the rest of her articles on medium.  She had one on empowering people that is particularly pertinent to a couple of conversations that we’ve had.</p>
<p>This article does a great job of outlining how a coach can move someone up the ladder of empowerment and autonomy so that they can reach a level of self-actualization.</p>
<p>There are several dichotomies of leadership and this is one of them: you have to give people autonomy but at the same time you don't want to abandon them.  I've seen a few leaders get this wrong: they were almost completely absent and didn't provide any direction (in the name of autonomy) and, as a result, the individuals and the team's performance suffered.</p>
<p>It's the job of a coach to give them the support that they need and, at low levels of TRM, this includes telling people what to do all the while coaching them to a level where they don't need as much support.   When you don't know what you don't know, you need a bit of direction.</p>
<p>I feel that too often, myself included, people get stuck in an all-or-nothing approach to autonomy but that is neither practical nor does it work when it isn't executed in a graduated manner.</p>

<hr>
<p>I've heard a few different ideas about what autonomy and management ideals mean around the office but it seems that there's some confusion as to what that actually looks like.</p>
<p>I get the feeling, from some of the conversations that I’ve heard around the office, that people here feel like autonomy is an all or nothing thing: that you shouldn't tell anybody what to do.  But this breaks down in a number of different circumstances.  The most notable of which is the low TRM employee who doesn't know what they don't know.</p>
<p>We talked about that situation and how you can give them something to work on that stretches them.</p>
<p>That, when the person has low TRM, includes telling them what to do since   Telling people what to do and autonomy are not mutually exclusive when used correctly in a coaching/mentoring context.</p>
