    <div class="content-body">
        <p>A few years back I took a job as a developer and shortly thereafter, through surprising and inexplicable circumstances, I found myself as the lead of the project.  The codebase that I took over was a rat's nest and I knew it was.  However, I didn't know how to fix it nor did I know all that was wrong with it.  I just had a feeling that all was not well in Mayberry.</p>
<p>Over the coming months, I mostly figured out what needed improving and I went about implementing those changes fervently.  The following are a few things that I learned during that experience and later.</p>
<h2>No Extraneous Code in Class Files or Interfaces</h2>
<p>This is one of the longest ropes that you can hang yourself with while using a scripting language.  You want to use a class and then there's a side-effect when you use it.  This makes it nearly impossible to change the usage of said class or even the class file itself.</p>
<p>In addition, you'll find that such systems are pure spaghetti code.  They're littered with messy and archaic coding practices that make it very time consuming to fix and improve.  It is a monolithic beast that is difficult to slay and proves the point that fast is slow.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>A New You</h4>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php">
</code></pre>
<h4>Requireitis</h4>
<p>Requiring files should be handled by your autoloader (in PHP that is Composer).</p>
<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php">
</code></pre>
