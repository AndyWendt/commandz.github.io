    <div class="content-body">
        <p>About nine months ago, we started development on a Node.js Serverless application hosted (if that is the proper term for serverless) on AWS Lambda. I started laying the architecture by writing code directly in the Lambda console, then I progressed to uploading zip files of the code, and then, finally, I found the Serverless framework.</p>
<p>Before Serverless, I would manually (or via a script) create API endpoints in AWS API Gateway and then hook them up to the appropriate Lambda function.  While I was able to take advantage of shared code, it seemed as though I was reinventing the wheel; solving a problem that had already been solved.  I was.</p>
<p>Serverless provided several significant advantages and improvements over creating our own in-house framework and deployment system.  It abstracted the process of deployment, CloudFormation template creation, and creation of API resources.</p>
<p>Once we switched over to the Serverless Framework, it was smooth sailing for months.  We even converted our JS over to Typescript and implemented an end-to-end and unit test suite.  It was all coming together and it felt as though it was working splendidly.</p>
<p>Until it didn't.</p>
<p>We had been adding API Endpoints but also DynamoDB resources to the <code>serverless.yml</code> file.  While I had researched and recommended that this particular team switch over to using <a href="https://github.com/automategreen/dynamoose">Dynamoose</a> for creating the DynamoDB tables and for querying, it hadn't been implemented (priorities, priorities). In addition, we had continued to define API resources in the standard <code>serverless.yml</code> syntax.</p>
<p>All this came to a head one day when one member of the team told me that we couldn't deploy.  Flabbergasted, I asked him why. It turned out that Serverless was telling us that we had a <code>Resource limit exceeded</code> error.  Digging a bit deeper, I found out that Cloudformation templates have a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html">maximum resource count</a> of 200 entities.</p>
<p>Evidently, all of our <a href="https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/">API endpoints</a> combined with our <a href="https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/resources/">DynamoDB definitions</a> amounted to more than 200 resources.  This particular API wasn't even that big.</p>
<p>What was a developer to do?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had found <a href="https://medium.com/trisfera/deploying-an-express-application-to-aws-lambda-the-easy-way-fa5fbef190ba">this article</a> earlier on Medium and I saw a way to define innumerable API endpoints without surpassing the Cloudformation Template limit.  So I put together a <a href="https://github.com/AndyWendt/serverless-express-example">boilerplate repo</a> that our team could base their work off of and it worked splendidly.</p>
<p>One of the benefits was the ability to easily use an actual framework in our code that allowed for the usage of middlewares and other goodies. It reduced quite a bit of code that we'd need to maintain while improving the layout of the codebase.</p>
<p>Along with that, it was easier to <a href="https://github.com/AndyWendt/serverless-express-example/blob/18cecdf23bc048c624948ecc218e6cab047f8af8/src/App.ts#L61-L64">define routes</a> and test them since they were located in one easy to use file (<code>App.ts</code> in this case). In addition, it allowed for an <a href="https://github.com/AndyWendt/serverless-express-example/blob/18cecdf23bc048c624948ecc218e6cab047f8af8/src/routes/HelloWorldController.ts">MVC like architecture</a> which improved not only our separation of concerns but also our ability to deliver code faster.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a worthwile endeavor.  I hope this helps you out!</p>
