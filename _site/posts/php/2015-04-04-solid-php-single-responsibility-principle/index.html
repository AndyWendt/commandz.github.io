        <p>The first of the SOLID principles is unfortunately violated quite often even though it is easy to understand why you<br>
want to maintain a separation of concerns.  It is similar to the SQL injection vulnerabilities that show up on<br>
StackOverflow and other places even though the internet is flooded with warnings about how to avoid being pwnd by the<br>
easily escapable beast.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AndyWendt/solid-php-examples/blob/master/src/SingleResonsibilityPrinciple/violation/BasketballPlayerAndCoach.php">In the example repository</a>,<br>
I give the example of a basketball player that is both a coach and a player.<br>
While there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_player-coaches">several examples in NBA history of successful player coaches</a>,<br>
none have won coach of the year and only two have won championships as player-coaches.</p>
<p>Since we are pursuing excellence, why would split our focus by being both a player and a coach?  There are several examples<br>
of player-coaches going back to focusing on their playing career since it is very difficult to be great as both.</p>
<p>In warfare, it is a maxim to divide your enemies forces so that they cannot focus their strength.  Thus it is so with<br>
player-coaches.  They are at best a jack of all trades that has to deal with the politics of leading a team as well as<br>
the dynamics of winning basketball games on the court.</p>
<p>We should keep these principles in mind when we are designing objects and their interrelations.  How does it<br>
make sense to have a player object that is also a coach object?  As you can see from the example repository, the<br>
responsibilities that the PlayerCoach object takes on are contradictory in nature and would be confusing when<br>
utilized in code.</p>
<p>To sum up, don't have your objects be a PlayerCoach.  Have multiple objects: <a href="https://github.com/AndyWendt/solid-php-examples/tree/master/src/SingleResonsibilityPrinciple/correct">player and coach</a><br>
that can leverage their individual capabilities to their fullest.</p>
<p>To see if you are violating this principle, try extracting all of the interfaces that you can for a given class and see<br>
if they make sense to be utilized in the same class.  Just make sure that your interfaces (or contracts) conform to the<br>
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).</p>
