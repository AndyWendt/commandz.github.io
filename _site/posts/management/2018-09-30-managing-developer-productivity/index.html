    <div class="content-body">
        <p>Anyone who has been in software development for very long has experienced an all-nighter.  Typically the dev or devs who pull the venerable feat of ridiculousness are lauded and praised for their efforts &quot;for the client&quot; or &quot;for the team.&quot;  They're seen as a hero worthy of a Roman triumph for saving the client again and for giving it 110% - at least until next time.</p>
<p>However, what if these efforts are actually counter-productive and indicative of a faulty organizational culture and Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?</p>
<p>Somewhere during the management transition from being over physical workers to being over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge workers</a> managers didn't quite figure out that the two are intrinsically different endeavors.  Unfortunately, the managing the physical laborer mindset has predominantly stuck at most institutions.</p>
<p>In a sick and twisted combination of the <a href="">Labor Theory of Value</a> and the <a href="">Profit Motive</a>, ineffective managers and organizations are fixated on the idea that one additional hour of work is one additional unit of productivity.  And so it is with the afforementioned all-nighter.  They believe that pushing people and teams to work overtime and all night to save the day is a bonus to the company and not a net negative.</p>
<p>What they fail to realize is that one hour of sitting in a chair behind a computer doesn't equate to one hour of brain time or of deep work.  It should be self-evident - though most don't make the connection - that the knowledge worker's primary game is thinking: not answering messages and being a networking hub.  Is that how most manager's think about productivity?  I doubt it.  In [one particularly illustrative narrative](Peopleware reference), an engineer was working on a difficult set of problems, ones which would challenge the temerity of even the best engineer, while staring out the window with his feet propped up on his desk.  His manager came in and asked, &quot;what are you doing?&quot;  To which he replied, &quot;I'm thinking.&quot;  Tis the mindset of command and control management: if you don't look busy or sound busy, you're not working.</p>
<p>This doesn't correallate to the thinking person's sport called knowledge work.  To accomplish knowledge work you need to think and you need to think deeply while not distracted. Unfortunately, most of our office environments and work processes are anti-flow.  They limit and do not enhance the effectiveness of the knowledge worker.</p>
<p>In their book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113f">Peopleware</a>, Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister discuss the phenomenom of flow: the state in which work that requires significant concentration is a pleasure and easier easy to do.  In several different studies, it has been shown that people who are in an environment where they can concentrate are significantly more productive and much less error prone than those who are not.</p>
<p>The environment of most organizations is conducive to short and shallow work that requires little in the way of original thought.  Some people shine in such environments because of the type of tasks that they've been assigned.  They churn out massive amounts of cheap work in a constant shallow state of distraction all the while reaping the accolades of management.  When they're moved to a different position that requires actual deep thinking - and they will be because of their so-called &quot;productivity&quot; - they often flounder or they end up putting in massive amounts of overtime and or working odd hours so that they can &quot;concentrate.&quot;</p>
<p>In Cal Newport's book <a href="">Deep Work</a> he introduces the concept of the books namesake: deep work.</p>
<p>Drucker (1966) defines six factors for knowledge worker productivity:[19]</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge worker productivity demands that we ask the question: &quot;What is the task?&quot;</li>
<li>It demands that we impose the responsibility for their productivity on the individual knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge workers have to manage themselves.</li>
<li>Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and the responsibility of knowledge workers.</li>
<li>Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of the knowledge worker.</li>
<li>Productivity of the knowledge worker is not — at least not primarily — a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as important.</li>
<li>Finally, knowledge worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an &quot;asset&quot; rather than a &quot;cost.&quot; It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>but they don't see the hidden cost of replacement and burnout</p>
<p>For instance, even open office floor plans are distraction factories that rarely allow knowledge workers to enter a state of flow, they are</p>
<p>taking the worst of the profit motive and the labor theory of value</p>
<p>It is not the labor itself but the quality and the utility</p>
<p>The necessity of downtime (esp from technology)</p>
<p>the point:  is that you don't manage developer productivity you create an environment in which it can grow</p>
